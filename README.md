My real name is Mahendra. I have basic programming in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP.
I haven't written code for a long time so i forgot, therefore i learn again and save my learning process here.
Please review my code and help me to become a Chief Technology Officer.

I also make generative or interactive art with 2D/3D visual/models and i keep it here, so don't forget to review my work.
If you use my code for generative or interactive art, please feel free and thank you for including me as a source.

I'm happy to help.
